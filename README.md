Project: Create a NFT collection

Description: This is a simple javascript project created using arrays and basic loop functions which could hold a number of NFTs and list them with the total no of NFTs.
Project Overview
The project is designed to demonstrate how to manage a collection of NFTs using JavaScript. It involves the following main components:

NFT Object: A JavaScript object that represents an NFT with attributes such as name, total supply, and value.

NFT Collection Array: An array used to store multiple NFT objects, simulating a collection of NFTs.

Functions: Several functions are defined to interact with the NFT collection:

mintNFT: Adds a new NFT object to the collection.
listNFTs: Lists all NFTs in the collection along with their details.
getTotalSupply: Displays the total count of NFTs in the collection.
